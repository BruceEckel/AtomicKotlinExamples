# Atomic Kotlin Examples

These are the code examples from the book [Atomic Kotlin](https://www.AtomicKotlin.com), created by an
automatic extraction process directly from the book. This repository provides
a test of the code that is shown in the book, to verify that it is correct.

Although you can download this repository and run the build system, the
examples are more conveniently available pre-integrated with the Intellij IDEA
development environment, along with the exercises and solutions for the book.
See *AtomicKotlin.com* for the IDEA examples.

## Quick Version

Before you can run the examples from this repository, you must install:

1. The current version of [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html),
although some earlier versions should also work.

2. The latest version (1.3 or higher) of the [Kotlin command-line
compiler](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html).

If you just want to download and check the code, [Download
Here](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples/archive/master.zip)
and unzip into your destination directory. Open a shell/command window and
move into the root of that directory. You'll know you are in the right
directory if you see the files `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`.

On Mac/Linux, enter:

```
./gradlew run
```

(If you get a *Permission denied* error, run `chmod +x ./gradlew`)

On Windows, enter

```
gradlew run
```

You'll need an Internet connection the first time you compile the code,
because Gradle needs to first install itself, then all the support libraries.
Once these are installed you can perform additional compiling and running
offline.

If all goes well, the examples will run. Everything should complete without errors.

All the book examples are in the subdirectory `Examples` in subdirectories
corresponding to the atom names.

To compile and run examples using the Kotlin command-line tools, see
[Command-Line Hello World](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples/blob/master/Command_Line_Hello_World.md).

## Using JetBrains IDEA

Follow the tutorials [Here](https://www.atomickotlin.com/exercises/).

# Detailed Instructions

If you are not familiar with the command line, first read [Command-Line
Basics](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples/blob/master/Command_Line_Basics.md).

## Install Java

Kotlin runs on top of Java, so you must first install Java (you only need basic
Java; the development kit also works but is not required).

### Windows

1. Follow the instructions at this link to [Install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

2. At a shell prompt, type:Â `choco install jdk8` (you may also select a more recent version). This  takes some time,
but when it's finished Java is installed and the necessary environment
variables are set.

### Macintosh

The Mac comes with a much older version of Java that won't work for the
examples in this book, so you'll need to update it to (at least) Java 8.

  1.  Follow the instructions at this link to [Install HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/)

  2.  At a shell prompt, first type `brew update`. When that completes, enter
      `brew cask install java`.

**NOTE:** Sometimes the default version of Java that you get with the above
installation will be too recent and not validated by the Mac's security
system. If this happens you'll either need to turn off the security by hand
or install an earlier version of Java. For either choice, you'll need to Google
for answers on how to solve the problem (often the easiest approach is to just
search for the error message produced by the Mac).

### Linux

Use the standard package installer with the following shell commands:

*Ubuntu/Debian*:

  1. `sudo apt-get update`

  2. `sudo apt-get install default-jdk`

*Fedora/Redhat*:

```
su -c "yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk"
```

## Verify Your Installation

Open a new shell and type:

```
java -version
```

You should see something like the following (Version numbers and actual text
will vary):

```
java version "10.0.2" 2018-07-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13, mixed mode)
```

If you see a message that the command is not found or not recognized, review
the installation instructions. If you still can't get it to work, check
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=installing+java).

## Installing and Running the Book Examples

Once you have Java installed, the process to install and run the book examples
is the same for all platforms:

1. Download the book examples from the
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples/archive/master.zip).

2. `unzip` the downloaded file into the directory of your choice.

3. Use the Windows Explorer, the Mac Finder, or Nautilus or equivalent on Linux
to browse to the directory where you uzipped `AtomicKotlinExamples`, and open a
shell there.

4. If you're in the right directory, you should see files named `gradlew` and
`gradlew.bat` in that directory, along with numerous other files and
directories. The directories correspond to the chapters in the book.

5. At the shell prompt, type `gradlew run` (Windows) or `./gradlew run`
(Mac/Linux).

The first time you do this, Gradle will install itself and numerous other
packages, so it will take some time. After everything is installed, subsequent
builds and runs will be much faster.

Note that you must be connected to the Internet the first time you run `gradlew`
so that Gradle can download the necessary packages.

# Using `run`

In each atom-named subdirectory under the `Examples` directory, you will see
two files: `run.bat` and `run.sh`. These are convenience commands for Windows
and Mac/Linux that allow you to compile and run the examples in that
subdirectory. They are not necessary to build the code, but if you begin
experimenting with individual examples they are helpful.

To run these scripts, you must first install a recent version of
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

If you just type `run` (`./run.sh` in Mac/Linux), it will (using
Gradle) compile and run all the examples in the directory. You can also type
`run AnExample.kt` to compile and run the example `AnExample.kt` (assuming it
has a `main()`).

If you get a *Permission denied* error on OSX or Linux, run `chmod +x ./run.sh`

# Running Kotlin from the Command Line

The Kotlin interpreter is also called the REPL (for *Read-Evaluate-Print-
Loop*). To use this you must first install the command-line version of Kotlin.

> NOTE: You do not need to install command-line Kotlin for the operations
> described previously in this README.

## Install Kotlin

In this book, we use Kotlin version 1.3, the latest available at the time. The
detailed installation instructions for the command-line compiler are available
at [The Kotlin Site](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html).

To check your installation, open a new shell and type:

```
kotlin -version
```

at the shell prompt. You'll see the version information for your Kotlin
installation.

## The REPL

You get the REPL when you type `kotlinc` by itself on the command line. You
should see something like the following:

```
Welcome to Kotlin version 1.3 (JRE 1.8.0_144-b01)
Type :help for help, :quit for quit
>>>
```

The exact version numbers will vary depending on the versions of Kotlin
and Java you've installed, but make sure that you're running Kotlin 1.3
or greater.

The REPL gives you immediate interactive feedback, which is helpful for
experimentation. For example, you can do arithmetic:

```
>>> 42 * 11.3
474.6
```

Find out more by typing `:help` at the Kotlin prompt. To exit the REPL,
type:

```
>>> :quit
```

To compile and run examples using the Kotlin command-line tools, see
[Command-Line Hello World](https://github.com/BruceEckel/AtomicKotlinExamples/blob/master/Command_Line_Hello_World.md).

# Testing

The test system is built in so that we (the authors) can verify the correctness
of what goes into the book. You don't need to run the tests, but if you want
to:

1. `gradlew GenerateTests` generates tests from the sources in this repository.
   It creates (or recreates) the file `TestExamples.java`. You normally don't need to run this; the
   `TestExamples.java` in the repository should be up to date.

2. `gradlew TestExamples` runs the tests in `TestExamples.java`.

Alternatively, `TestExamples.java` can be called as a regular **JUnit** test class.
